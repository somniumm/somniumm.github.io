1. BIM takes in geometry in properties rather than points. Thiis fundamentally differentiates it from other 3D modeling software such as Rhino etc. A column in a BIM software such as Revit is identified as "column", not a NURBS or surface or its geometrical proprieties.

2. Data mining can be applied to BIM platform. Example such as
	2.1 For running building simulation, information pulled from BIM model can directly feed simulation software. Such a step of making a 3d modeling is reduced. 
	2.2 On the scale of design one building, using sensor data can help architects make design decision such as where to make a path or place a furniture. 
	2.3 scan space through camera (forgot the term: photo...) . Athesis student did work on analyze flickr photos people take for a famous architecture from different perspectives. It's possible to apply the method to study building circulations and other building decisions.

3. End user driven design approach. 
New tools encourage end users be involved in building design process.By providing data or by crowd sourcing.
