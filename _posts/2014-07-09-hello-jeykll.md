title: Folding Light 
---

Type: Parametric design
Year: 2013 
Tool: Rhino, Grasshopper, Fab lab.

Folding light is designed using parametric method with Rhino and Grasshopper and fabricated at the MIT fab lab. It embrace two basic premises. First, we test the reciprocity between two modes of design and confront the discordance between computer simulation and physical modeling. Second, because this is a design tool as opposed to a designed object, the project allowed us to input through implicit, variable and modifiable means of definition. Rather than a static output, we engaged parametric, simulative and genetic modeling methods.
