title: uArm Developer - development platform for robotics arm
---

uArm is a open source desktop robotic arm manipulator.  

I initiated a development platform that makes it easier for users to build their own applications for uArm. With two other friends, we built a beta version of the platform with an API library, basic communication protocols, processing SDK (python SDK coming soon).
