title: uArm Developer - development platform for robotics arm
---

uArm is a robotic arm manipulator, an actuator that moves in 3-Demisional space. The goal is by controlling the four servos simultaneously to move end effector in a volume of space.

I was in charge of developing a developer platform that allow user to build their apps on top of current platform. It contains an API library and communication protocols.
